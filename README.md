The site has 4 pages: 

Home page - The 'Home' page contains a Hero image of the exterior of the B&B (Often the first thing a potential customer wants to see), an eye-catching call to action booking button in the centre of the page which redirects to the Contact page, and an 'About us' section with a welcome message and brief background of the business.

Rooms -  The 'Rooms' page contains images of the two room types available and their prices, with additional 'book now' buttons which redirect to the Contact form/booking page.

See and do - The 'See and do' page contains suggestions for activities in the area which may be of interest to the B&B's guests, along with links to more information on each activity. 

Contact page - The 'Contact' page contains a contact form for customers to submit booking requests and questions to the company. This page also contains a map to the B&B and directions/transport options.

For consistency of user experience, the site logo, navigation links and footer remain consitent throughout the site.

### Wireframes:

Mock-ups were made using Balsamiq to help plan and visualise the site design. They were created for 3 main screen sizes: mobile, tablet and desktop.

> - [Wireframes](docs/rooms-wireframes.pdf): 'Rooms' page.
> - [Wireframes](docs/see-and-do-wireframes.pdf): 'See and do' page.

### Design:

* Colour Scheme:

The colour palette includes calm and complimenting colours which suit the countryside cottage feel that the site is aiming for. The palette was chosen using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) colour generator website.

The colours mainly used were:

Rosewood: #4F000B

Claret: #720026

Brickred: #CE4257

White was also used in different parts of the site to achieve the best possible contrast for user experience.

* Typography:
'Kaisei HarunoUmi', taken from Google Fonts, is the main font used throughout the website with 'Sans Serif' as the fallback font. It is clear, neat and appropriate for the homely feel that the site is aiming for. 

* Imagery:

All images were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

The main image on the home page is a beautiful remote old fashioned country cottage, surrounded by nature. This aims to evoke feelings of calm. 

The images on the 'See and do' offer a preview of the recommended local activites, and also provide a balance between imagery and text.

The image on the 'Contact' page aims to evoke feelings of cosiness and calm and compliments the site's colour scheme.
