Rooms -  The 'Rooms' page contains images of the two room types available and their prices, with additional 'book now' buttons which redirect to the Contact form/booking page.

See and do - The 'See and do' page contains suggestions for activities in the area which may be of interest to the B&B's guests, along with links to more information on each activity. 

Contact page - The 'Contact' page contains a contact form for customers to submit booking requests and questions to the company. This page also contains a map to the B&B and directions/transport options.

For consistency of user experience, the site logo, navigation links and footer remain consitent throughout the site.
