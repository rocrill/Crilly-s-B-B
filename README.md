Crilly's B&B is a website for a family-owned B&B business based in the small town of Maghera, Co. Derry. The website is aimed towards any holidaymakers who are looking for a quiet holiday in relaxing surroundings.

Users of this website will be able to gain a good insight into what it is like to stay at the B&B, the available facilites and what they can expect from the local area. They will have easy access to prices and a contact page where they can send an enquiry to book their desired room.

### Structure:

The site has 4 pages: 

Home page - The 'Home' page contains a Hero image of the exterior of the B&B (Often the first thing a potential customer wants to see), an eye-catching call to action booking button in the centre of the page which redirects to the Contact page, and an 'About us' section with a welcome message and brief background of the business.

Rooms -  The 'Rooms' page contains images of the two room types available and their prices, with additional 'book now' buttons which redirect to the Contact form/booking page.

See and do - The 'See and do' page contains suggestions for activities in the area which may be of interest to the B&B's guests, along with links to more information on each activity. 

Contact page - The 'Contact' page contains a contact form for customers to submit booking requests and questions to the company. This page also contains a map to the B&B and directions/transport options.

For consistency of user experience, the site logo, navigation links and footer remain consitent throughout the site.

### Wireframes:

Mock-ups were made using Balsamiq to help plan and visualise the site design. They were created for 3 main screen sizes: mobile, tablet and desktop.

- [Wireframes](docs/home-wireframes.pdf): 'Home' page.
- [Wireframes](docs/rooms-wireframes.pdf): 'Rooms' page.
- [Wireframes](docs/see-and-do-wireframes.pdf): 'See and do' page.
- [Wireframes](docs/contact-wireframes.pdf): 'Contact' page.

### Design:

* Colour Scheme:

  The colour palette includes calm and complimenting colours which suit the countryside cottage feel that the site is aiming for. The palette was chosen using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) colour generator website.

  ![Image of Color Palette](assets/images/color-palette-small.png)

  The colours mainly used were:

  Rosewood: #4F000B

  Claret: #720026

  Brickred: #CE4257

  White was also used in different parts of the site to achieve the best possible contrast for user experience.

* Typography:

  'Kaisei HarunoUmi', taken from Google Fonts, is the main font used throughout the website with 'Sans Serif' as the fallback font. It is clear, neat and appropriate for the homely feel that the site is aiming for. 

* Imagery:

  All images were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

  The main image on the home page is a beautiful remote old fashioned country cottage, surrounded by nature. This aims to evoke feelings of calm. 

  The images on the 'See and do' offer a preview of the recommended local activites, and also provide a balance between imagery and text.

  The image on the 'Contact' page aims to evoke feelings of cosiness and calm and compliments the site's colour scheme.

# Deployment

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The site was developed in GitPod and deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

* Navigate to the Github repository. For this project, this is rocrill/Crilly-s-B-B. 
* Navigate to the Settings tab, then to Pages.
* From the Source secton drop-down menu, select the Master Branch ( or Branch: Master and Root folder). Save.
* Once the master branch has been selected, you will see the message: 'Your site is published' and a link to the deployed site will be provided.

The live link can be found here - https://rocrill.github.io/Crilly-s-B-B/

*Note*: I wanted to neaten the end of the url from 'Crilly-s-B-B' when deploying the site, however I was too nervous that other parts of the project would be affected. I would neaten this in future, e.g. to 'crillys-bandb'. 

## Forking to GitHub Repository

You can create a fork (copy) of the repository. This allows you to experiment with the code without affecting the original project.

To fork the repository:

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. On GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to fork.
3. In the top right corner of the page, underneath your profile avatar, click Fork.
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a local clone:

You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer. Any changes made to the local copy will not affect the original project. To clone the Crilly-s-B-B project, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your GitHub account and locate the Crilly-s-B-B repository.
2. In the repository, click on Code button located above all the project files.
3. Under HTTPS, copy the link generated - https://github.com/rocrill/Crilly-s-B-B.git
4. Open the terminal you are using, e.g. Gitpod
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory created
6. Type git clone and then paste the URL you copied earlier: `git clone https://github.com/rocrill/Crilly-s-B-B.git`
8. Press Enter to create your local clone.

# Testing

I tested the site regularly during the development process, by previewing it in the live server window and inspecting with Google Chrome DevTools at various stages.

When I was editing for responsiveness I tested the site on several different devices.

At the final stages of the project the W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors.

## Testing User Stories from the UX Section

## Validator Testing

* HTML Validator Errors & Warnings:

  * Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections.

    Fixed: Changed a `section` element to a `div` element as the heading was not required.

  * Error: The element `button` must not appear as a descendant of the `a` element.

    Fixed: Replaced `button` element with an `input` within a `form`.

  * Error: The value of the `for` attribute of the `label` element must be the ID of a non-hidden form control.

    Fixed: Changed 'message' `class` to an `id` and matched the attribute value between the `label` and `textarea` elements.

* CSS Validator Errors & Warnings

  * Error: .attractions-container: `left` is not a `align-items` value.

  * Fix: Replaced code with `align-items: stretch;`

I re-ran the deployed site through both the HTML and CSS validators and no warnings or error were found:

Home page: 

![Image for Home lighthouse result](assets/images/home-lighthouse.png)

Rooms page: 

![Image for Rooms lighthouse result](assets/images/rooms-lighthouse.png)

See and do page: 

![Image for See and do lighthouse result](assets/images/seedo-lighthouse.png)

Contact page:

![Image for Contact lighthouse result](assets/images/contact-lighthouse.png)


## Further Testing

* Devices and browsers :

  * The Website was tested on multiple browsers - Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge and Firefox browsers.
  * The website was viewed on all devices available to me - Desktop, Laptop, iPhone6, Huawei Y6 and Oppo Find X2 Lite.

* Site Features:

  * The nav bar remains and the top of the page and the menu items adapt to remain within the nav bar on all devices.
  * The font is legible on all device sizes.
  * Images are resized where needed and never stretched or distorted on smaller devices.
  * All buttons and links direct to the correct parts of the site.

## Bugs

* Fixed:
  * At a later stage of the project I realised that on an actual iPhone 6, as opposed to the iPhone6 preview in DevTools, certain sections of the site were distorted, e.g. the nav menu items fell outside of the header. This was solved with `&nbsp` html. 
  * The 'Book now' button of the Rooms page was also displaced on the actual iPhone 6. This was fixed using CSS for this button within the mobile media query.
  * The button stying across the whole site on the iPhone6 was missing, this was resolved by adding `-webkit-appearance: none;` to the CSS for the styling of each button.
  * There was a 'Book now' button placement issue on Firefox desktop. This was resolved by using `&nbsp;` and increasing the width of the room price container.
  
* Known:
  * On a medium size device between desktop and mobile, on the Contact page, the Google Map does not centre perfectly over the Directions paragraph as it does in mobile. I spent a lot of time trying to fix this, but in the end did not have time to fix it without compromising the site on the desktop on mobile verions - on which I am happy with the map positioning.
